My name is Josh Cullings and I have been a computer science major a Montana State University for 4 years. I first got into the field through a promostion at my high school called "Hour of Code". Ever since I have loved the challenge and satisfaction that comes with developing code. In my years at MSU, I have had many opportunities to learn aspects of the field ranging from robotics, circuitry, and databases to software engineering, computational biology, and machine learning. I am set to graduate on December 14th, 2019. At the moment however, I am currently enrolled in Machine Learning, Networks, and Computational Biology courses. 

# Programming Backgrounnds

## Computational Biology
- Computational Biology
  - Studied and implemented algorithms for finding gene sequences in DNA. 
  *See Computational-Biology*

## Databases
*Primarily used:* SQLite
- Database Systems
  - Used SQL to built database frameworks
  
- Software Engineering Applications
  - Used SQL Workbench to built database for storing patient information
  - Used PHP to implement database and fight SQL injection attacks

## Electrical Engineering
- Intro to Logical Circuits
  - Built electrical circuits from truth tables and electrical diagrams
  - Implementation of VHDL code to run logic sets

## Network Setup/Management:
- Systems Administration
  - Linux Command Line to manage netwrok settings, permissions, file structure, updates, etc.
  
- Networks
  - Structure and processes of different network types 
  *See Networks*

## Robotics
- Robot Vision
  - Developed control software for university robots to complete specific tasks. 
  *See robotVision*

## Software Development:
- Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Design
  - Worked in a group of diverse backgrounds to create a working rc car, control app, and course.
  
- Software Engineering Applications
  - Paired with clients to develop apps in a sprint based format for real world applications. In our case we developed an app to track the progression of mental health patients.
  - Worked in scrum environment, using smartsheet
  
- Compilers
  - Worked in a team of 3 to develop a compiler for Tiny Basic. 
  *See compilers*

- Machine Learning
  - Worked in a team of 4, in a scrum environment, to implement multi-layer feedforward neural networks, stacked auto-encoders, the radial basis function, the Naive Bayes function, and evolutionary algorithms.
  *See Machine-Learning*
