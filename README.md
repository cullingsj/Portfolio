Welcome to Josh's online portfolio.

# Overview
My name is Josh Cullings and I have been a computer science major a Montana State University for 4 years. I first got into the field through a promostion at my high school called "Hour of Code". Ever since I have loved the challenge and satisfaction that comes with developing code. In my years at MSU, I have had many opportunities to create control systems for electrical systems (Logical Circuits), robotics (Robot Vision), and made from scratch rc cars (Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Design). I also gained valuable experience working an a sprint-based software engineering team in which we designed a web app to help with tracking the progression of mental health patients.
