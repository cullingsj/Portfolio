# Overview

My name is Josh Cullings and I recently graduated from Montana State University in Computer Science. I first got into the field through a promostion at my high school called "Hour of Code". Ever since I have loved the challenge and satisfaction that comes with developing code. In my years at MSU, I have had many opportunities to learn aspects of the field ranging from robotics, circuitry, and databases to software engineering, computational biology, and machine learning.

Through previous jobs I have had experience in the areas of customer service as well as dealing with stressful situations. For the 3 years each that I was at McDonald’s and Famous Dave’s I was positioned on customer service: taking food orders, handling transactions, and helping customers. These being restaurants, I was often dealing with customers and difficult questions on a regular basis. Through the countless hours that I spent working in this environment I found that team cohesion/coexistence and personability are acquired skills and worked on this thoroughly in an effort to make the interactions more enjoyable and, most importantly, beneficial for customers, coworkers, and myself. 

During high school I also took part in an online class for Carroll College where I was required to intern at the local clinic. One of my duties while working at this hospital was to record the patient’s information, including sensitive medical information, to the clinic’s database. These experiences qualify me because through them I learned how to handle sensitive/confidential information and how to interact with others in a way that conveys information in a concise and friendly manner. Further explanation of my work experience can be located in my resume.

# Programming Backgrounnds
