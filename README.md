# Overview
My name is Josh Cullings and I have been a computer science major a Montana State University for 4 years. I first got into the field through a promostion at my high school called "Hour of Code". Ever since I have loved the challenge and satisfaction that comes with developing code. In my years at MSU, I have had many opportunities to create control systems for electrical systems (Logical Circuits), robotics (Robot Vision), and made from scratch rc cars (Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Design).  I also gained valuable experience working an a sprint-based software engineering team in which we designed a web app to help with tracking the progression of mental health patients.  At the moment I am currently enrolled in Machine Learning, Networks, and Computational Biology courses. 

# Programming Backgrounnds

## Network Setup/Management:
- Systems Administration
  - Linux Command Line to manage netwrok settings, permissions, file structure, updates, etc.
  
- Networks
  - Structure and processes of different network types

## Software Development:
- Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Design
  - Worked in a group of diverse backgrounds to create a working rc car, control app, and course.
  
- Software Engineering Applications
  - Paired with clients to develop apps in a sprint based format for real world applications. In our case we developed an app to track the progression of mental health patients.
  
- Compilers
  - Worked in a team of 3 to develop a compiler for Tiny Basic

## Robotics
- Robot Vision
  - Developed control software for university robots to complete specific tasks.

## Electrical Engineering
- Intro to Logical Circuits
  - Built electrical circuits from truth tables and electrical diagrams
  - Implementation of VHDL code to run logic sets
